"90 percent of the world’s coral reefs will disappear in the next 35 years due to coral bleaching induced by global warming, pollution, and overdevelopment.",mostly correct,correct,INCORRECT,"The claim that 90 percent of the world’s coral reefs will disappear in the next 35 years due to coral bleaching induced by global warming, pollution, and overdevelopment is not directly supported by the evidence provided. The evidence states that coral reefs are projected to decline by a further 70–90% at 1.5°C of global warming with high confidence. It also mentions the degradation of coral reefs in Australia and the risks of species extinction or irreversible loss of biodiversity in coral reefs with very high confidence. Additionally, there is evidence of the degradation of tropical shallow coral reefs and associated biodiversity and ecosystem service values due to global warming.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that this decline will occur within the next 35 years, nor does it attribute the decline solely to coral bleaching induced by global warming, pollution, and overdevelopment. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate based on the evidence provided.

Discovery Of Massive Volcanic CO2 Emissions Discredits Global Warming Theory,inaccurate,incorrect,INCORRECT,"The claim that the discovery of massive volcanic CO2 emissions discredits the global warming theory is ((incorrect)).

The evidence provided indicates that while large explosive volcanic eruptions can temporarily mask human-caused climate change by reducing global surface temperature and precipitation, especially over land, for one to three years, a sequence of such eruptions within decades is a low-likelihood high-impact event that would lead to substantial cooling globally and regional climate perturbations over several decades. This means that while volcanic eruptions can have a short-term cooling effect, they do not discredit the long-term global warming trend caused by human activities.

Furthermore, the evidence also highlights that the increases in CO2 and CH4 concentrations far exceed natural multi-millennial changes between glacial and interglacial periods, and the net cooling effect from anthropogenic aerosols peaked in the late 20th century. This indicates that human activities are the primary drivers of the observed global warming.

Additionally, it is stated that sustained warming levels between 2°C and 3°C could lead to the loss of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia.

Additionally, the evidence indicates that human influence has been the main driver of these changes since at least 1971, and that the scale of recent changes across the climate system is unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years.

Furthermore, the evidence highlights that the impacts of climate change have affected both human and natural systems across the world, with those who have generally contributed least to climate change being the most vulnerable.

The U.S. Climate Reference Network... finds there has been no warming for the past 14 years at least.,incorrect,incorrect,INCORRECT,"The claim that ""The U.S. Climate Reference Network finds there has been no warming for the past 14 years at least"" is ((incorrect)) based on the evidence provided. The evidence clearly indicates that global surface temperatures have increased significantly over the past century, with the most recent decade overlapping with the multi-century temperature range. Additionally, there is high confidence in the increase in global surface temperature, and it is stated that global warming of 2°C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in CO2 and other GHG emissions occur.

The evidence also shows that the warming observed between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019 is caused by humans, and the increases in CO2 and CH4 concentrations far exceed natural multi-millennial changes. Furthermore, it is highlighted that global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years.

Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence provided, indicating that there has indeed been warming over the past 14 years.

CO2 is not the cause of our current warming trend; Arctic sea ice has expanded in recent years; Polar bears’ population is growing and is not threatened by climate change; CO2 is good for plant life,incorrect,incorrect,INCORRECT,"The claim consists of multiple subclaims, so I will evaluate each one separately based on the provided evidence.

1. CO2 is not the cause of our current warming trend:
The evidence provided clearly states that CO2 concentrations have increased significantly since 1750 and have a very likely and virtually certain warming effect on the global climate system. Therefore, the claim that CO2 is not the cause of our current warming trend is ((incorrect)).

2. Arctic sea ice has expanded in recent years:
The evidence states that there has been Arctic sea ice loss since 1979, which contradicts the claim that Arctic sea ice has expanded in recent years. Therefore, the claim that Arctic sea ice has expanded in recent years is ((incorrect)).

3. Polar bears’ population is growing and is not threatened by climate change:
The evidence does not directly address the population growth of polar bears, but it does mention Arctic sea ice loss, which is a significant threat to polar bears as it affects their habitat and food sources. Therefore, the claim that polar bears’ population is growing and is not threatened by climate change is ((incorrect)).

4. CO2 is good for plant life:
While it is true that CO2 is essential for plant life, the claim oversimplifies the complex effects of increased CO2 concentrations on plant life, including potential negative impacts such as changes in nutrient content and water use efficiency. Therefore, the claim that CO2 is good for plant life is ((incorrect)).

The warming is not nearly as great as the climate change computer models have predicted.,misleading,incorrect,INCORRECT,"Based on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim ""The warming is not nearly as great as the climate change computer models have predicted"" is not supported. The evidence indicates that the warming observed between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019 is caused by humans, and the magnitude and rate of climate change depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions. Additionally, it is stated that only a small number of the most ambitious global modelled pathways limit global warming to 1.5°C without overshoot. Furthermore, all global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve reductions in both net CO2 emissions and non-CO2 emissions with high confidence.

Therefore, the claim is ((incorrect)) based on the provided evidence.

"That one little burp by Mt.

Etna has already put more than 10,000 times the CO2 into the atmosphere than mankind has in our entire time on the Earth"" is ((incorrect)).

The evidence provided states that CO2 concentrations reached 410 parts per million (ppm) in 2019, and that increases in CO2 and CH4 concentrations far exceed natural multi-millennial changes over at least the past 800,000 years. It also mentions that current CO2 concentrations are higher than at any time over at least the past two million years. These points indicate that human activities have significantly impacted CO2 levels in the atmosphere.

Additionally, the evidence mentions that the net cooling effect from anthropogenic aerosols peaked in the late 20th century, and that concentrations of CH4 and N2O have increased to levels unprecedented in at least 800,000 years. This further supports the significant impact of human activities on greenhouse gas concentrations.

Therefore, the claim that Mt. Etna's CO2 emissions exceed mankind's emissions is not supported by the evidence provided, and is therefore ((incorrect)).
