Additionally, it is mentioned that coral reefs have already declined by over 99%. While the evidence highlights significant threats to coral reefs, such as global warming and other factors, the specific claim of 90% disappearing in the next 35 years is not directly supported by the evidence provided.

Sea level rise could reach six or seven feet by the year 2100.,correct,correct,INCORRECT,"The claim that ""Sea level rise could reach six or seven feet by the year 2100"" is not directly supported by the evidence provided. The evidence states that over the next 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about 2 to 3 meters if warming is limited to 1.5°C and 2 to 6 meters if limited to 2°C, with low confidence.
