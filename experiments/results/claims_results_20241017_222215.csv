"90 percent of the world’s coral reefs will disappear in the next 35 years due to coral bleaching induced by global warming, pollution, and overdevelopment.",mostly correct,correct,NOT_ENOUGH_INFORMATION,"((not_enough_information))

Explanation: 

While the evidence provided does indicate that coral reefs are declining and will face significant challenges due to global warming, it does not provide sufficient information to assess the specific claim of 90 percent of the world's coral reefs disappearing in the next 35 years. The evidence cited only mentions a decline of 70-90% at a global warming level of 1.5°C, which is projected to occur in the future, but it does not specify a time frame of exactly 35 years.

Furthermore, the provided evidence does not mention the specific cause of coral bleaching (global warming, pollution, and overdevelopment) as being responsible for this decline. While these factors are mentioned in the introduction, they are not explicitly linked to the projected decline of coral reefs.

Therefore, without more information or clarification on the specific claim, it is not possible to assess its accuracy with certainty.",NOT_ENOUGH_INFORMATION,NOT_ENOUGH_INFORMATION,"((not_enough_information))

Sea level rise could reach six or seven feet by the year 2100.,correct,correct,NOT_ENOUGH_INFORMATION,"((not_enough_information))

Explanation:
The provided evidence does not explicitly state that sea level rise could reach six or seven feet by the year 2100. While it mentions that higher greenhouse gas emissions lead to greater and faster rates of sea level rise, and that extreme sea level events are projected to occur at least annually at more than half of all tide gauge locations by 2100, it does not provide a specific estimate for sea level rise by 2100.

The evidence does mention relative sea level rise (2150, 2300) compared to 1900, but this is not directly comparable to an absolute estimate of six or seven feet. Additionally, the example provided shows a range of possible sea levels (2000 2100 2200 2300+) without specifying a particular outcome for 2100.

More than 100 percent of the warming over the past century is due to human actions.,mostly correct,correct,CORRECT,"((correct))

Explanation:

The claim that more than 100 percent of the warming over the past century is due to human actions can be evaluated based on the provided evidence. The evidence suggests that human influence is the main driver of ocean warming, accounting for 91% of the heating in the climate system (Reference: Evidence 1). Additionally, the observed global surface temperature increase from 1850-1900 to 2011-2020 is attributed to emissions from human activities with GHG warming partly masked by aerosol cooling (Reference: Evidence 4).

Furthermore, the concentration of GHGs has increased, which contributes to the warming trend (Reference: Answer 3). While solar and volcanic drivers also play a role in climate variability, their impact is relatively small compared to human-induced factors (Reference: Evidence 2).

The level of evidence and agreement for this claim can be classified as high. The majority of the evidence points to human actions as the primary cause of warming over the past century. However, it's essential to note that internal variability also plays a role in climate change, but its impact is relatively small compared to human-induced factors.

"The jet stream meanders more, with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes.",correct but,correct,CORRECT,"((correct))

Explanation:

The claim that the jet stream meanders more, with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes, is supported by evidence from climate science. The fact that hot extremes (including heatwaves) have become more frequent and intense across most land regions since the 1950s, while cold extremes have become less frequent and less severe, suggests that changes in atmospheric circulation patterns, such as those influenced by the jet stream, may be contributing to these shifts.

Reference: WGII TS C.4.2 (page not provided, URL not available)

Note: The exact relationship between the jet stream and extreme weather events is complex and still being researched. However, the overall trend of more frequent and intense heatwaves and less frequent cold extremes supports the idea that changes in atmospheric circulation patterns may be playing a role.

A series of just-released studies by working-level scientists prove that geological and not atmospheric forces are responsible for melting of Earth’s polar ice sheets.,inaccurate,incorrect,NOT_ENOUGH_INFORMATION,"((not_enough_information))

Explanation: 
The provided evidence does not support the claim that geological forces are responsible for melting of Earth's polar ice sheets. The evidence presented focuses on the attribution of extreme weather events to human influence, which is a well-established scientific consensus (Figure 2.3). However, it does not provide any information about the role of geological forces in melting polar ice sheets.

The sequence of large explosive volcanic eruptions mentioned in the evidence is actually expected to have a cooling effect on the climate, rather than contributing to melting of polar ice sheets (WGI SPM B.5.3, WGI SPM C.3, etc.).

No one really knows if last year (2016) was a (global temperature) record.,unsupported,incorrect,CORRECT,"((correct))

Explanation:
The claim that no one really knows if last year (2016) was a global temperature record can be evaluated based on the provided evidence. The evidence suggests that prior to 2016, the next most recent warm period occurred around 125,000 years ago, which overlaps with the observations of the past decade. This implies that the current warming trend is not unprecedented in Earth's history.

Furthermore, formal detection and attribution studies have shown that the best estimate is that all the warming observed between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019 is caused by humans (panel (d)). This suggests that human activities are likely contributing to the current global temperature record.

Additionally, the global surface temperature has increased by around 1.1°C since 1850–1900 (panel (c)), which provides a clear indication of the magnitude of warming over the past century and a half. The estimated temperature during the warmest multi-century period in at least the last 100,000 years occurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial period (Holocene), which further supports the idea that the current warming trend is not unprecedented.

Therefore, based on the provided evidence, it can be concluded that the claim is false. The evidence suggests that there is a high level of confidence in attributing the observed warming to human activities, and the magnitude of warming over the past century and a half is well established.

"Photo A little science lesson for the #idiots at the global warming conference. Ice berg melts, ocean level remains the same.",incorrect,incorrect,CORRECT,"((correct))

Explanation: 

The claim that ""Ice berg melts, ocean level remains the same"" is false. According to the evidence provided, the updated calculations for global surface temperature from 1850-1900 to 2013-2022 are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C, which indicates an increase in global surface temperature. This warming is expected to lead to increased melting of ice sheets, including those in Greenland and West Antarctica, resulting in significant sea-level rise.

The evidence from the Arctic also suggests that changes in surface temperature are not limited to just the melting of icebergs, but rather a more complex process involving the entire Arctic region. The fact that risks for coastal ecosystems, people, and infrastructure will continue to increase beyond 2100 due to sustained warming levels between 2°C and 3°C further supports the notion that ocean level will rise as a result of global warming.

Discovery Of Massive Volcanic CO2 Emissions Discredits Global Warming Theory,inaccurate,incorrect,CORRECT,"((correct))

Explanation:

The claim that the discovery of massive volcanic CO2 emissions discredits global warming theory is incorrect. The evidence provided suggests that human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and agriculture, are responsible for the significant increases in CO2 concentrations over the past 800,000 years, far exceeding natural fluctuations.

The evidence also suggests that public and private finance flows for fossil fuels are still greater than those for climate adaptation and mitigation, but this does not necessarily imply that the discovery of massive volcanic CO2 emissions would discredit global warming theory. The overwhelming majority of tracked climate finance is directed towards mitigation efforts, which further supports the notion that human activities are driving the observed increases in CO2 concentrations.

Marine life has nothing whatsoever to fear from ocean acidification.,unsupported,incorrect,NOT_ENOUGH_INFORMATION,"((correct))

Explanation:
The claim that ""Marine life has nothing whatsoever to fear from ocean acidification"" is incorrect. Ocean acidification, which is a consequence of increased CO2 absorption by oceans, can have significant impacts on marine ecosystems and species.

While the provided evidence does not directly address ocean acidification, it highlights the broader consequences of sea level rise and its potential effects on coastal ecosystems and marine life. The projections for sea level rise in meters relative to 1900 sea level rise by 2100 depend on emissions scenarios, which can lead to chronic high-tide flooding and extreme flooding during storms.

Furthermore, ocean acidification is a well-documented consequence of climate change, and its impacts on marine ecosystems are being studied extensively. For example, WGII TS.C.13.3 (Reference) discusses the effects of ocean acidification on marine organisms, including coral reefs and shellfish.

Therefore, based on the available evidence and understanding of ocean acidification, it is clear that marine life does have something to fear from ocean acidification, making the claim incorrect.

"Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated.",inaccurate,incorrect,ERROR_PARSING_RESPONSE,"((correct))

Explanation:

The claim that ""Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated"" can be evaluated based on the provided evidence. The evidence states that sea level rise is unavoidable due to deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt, with a high confidence level in this statement (WGII TS.C.13.3). Additionally, it is stated that global mean sea level rise will continue in the 21st century with a virtually certain outcome.

The evidence also highlights the dependence of sea level rise on emissions, with higher emissions leading to greater and faster rates of sea level rise. This suggests that human activities are contributing to the acceleration of sea level rise, which contradicts the claim.

Believing CO2 controls the climate is pretty close to believing in magic.,incorrect,incorrect,CORRECT,"((correct))

Explanation:
The claim that believing CO2 controls the climate is similar to believing in magic can be evaluated based on the provided evidence.

Firstly, the evidence suggests that increases in CO2 concentrations since 1750 have far exceeded natural changes over at least the past 800,000 years (very high confidence). This indicates a significant impact of human activities on the climate system. The fact that anthropogenic aerosols had a net cooling effect that peaked in the late 20th century also supports this conclusion.

Secondly, the evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since AR5 (Figure 2.3). This suggests a clear link between CO2 emissions and climate change.

Given these points, it is reasonable to conclude that believing CO2 controls the climate is not equivalent to believing in magic. The evidence supports the notion that human activities, particularly the increase in CO2 concentrations, have a significant impact on the climate system.

There has been no reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last century.,inaccurate,incorrect,CORRECT,"((correct))

Explanation:

The claim that there has been no reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last century can be evaluated based on the provided evidence.

Firstly, Evidence 1 (WGII TS.C.13.3) and Evidence 2 (SROCC SPM B.4) both indicate that ocean acidification is a real phenomenon that will continue to increase in the 21st century due to GHG emissions. Ocean acidification refers to the decrease in pH levels of the ocean, which is caused by the absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere.

According to Evidence 1 and Evidence 2, ocean acidification is considered a high-priority issue (WGII TS.C.13.3) and is expected to continue at rates dependent on future emissions (WGI SPM B.2, WGI SPM B.2.2). This suggests that the pH levels of the ocean have indeed decreased over the last century.

Furthermore, Evidence 1 states that many changes due to past and future GHG emissions are irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales, especially in the ocean (Evidence 1). This implies that the decrease in oceanic pH levels is a long-term trend that will continue for centuries to millennia.

Therefore, based on the provided evidence, it can be concluded that there has been a reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last century. The claim that there has been no reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last century is incorrect.

"Natural variation explains a substantial part of global warming observed since 1850; no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying natural disasters, or making them more frequent.",incorrect,incorrect,CORRECT,"((correct))

Explanation:
The claim that natural variation explains a substantial part of global warming observed since 1850 is supported by the evidence provided. The first piece of evidence states that natural variability will modulate human-caused changes, either attenuating or amplifying projected changes, especially at regional scales, with little effect on centennial global warming. This suggests that while natural variation plays a role in global temperature fluctuations, it does not dominate the trend.

However, the second piece of evidence contradicts the claim by stating that evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones has strengthened since AR5 (Figure 2.3). This implies that there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that human influence is contributing to an increase in extreme weather events.

Therefore, while natural variation does play a role in global warming, the available evidence suggests that it is not the sole explanation for the observed trend. The claim that no statistical evidence supports global warming intensifying or making natural disasters more frequent is therefore incorrect.

Explanation:
The claim is supported by evidence from peer-reviewed studies and geologic records. The statement that the global upper ocean has warmed since the 1970s, with human influence being the main driver, is consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). According to the provided evidence, ocean warming accounted for approximately 91% of the heating in the climate system.

Additionally, the observation of changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since AR5.

"Climate changed naturally in prehistoric eras, modern climate change is a naturally occurring phenomenon",flawed reasoning,incorrect,NOT_ENOUGH_INFORMATION,"((correct))

Explanation:
The claim that climate changed naturally in prehistoric eras and modern climate change is a naturally occurring phenomenon can be partially supported by the evidence provided.

Firstly, the statement ""In the near term, natural variability149 will modulate human-caused changes"" suggests that natural factors can influence climate change, which aligns with the idea that climate has always changed naturally. This is consistent with the concept of natural climate variability.

However, the evidence also highlights the importance of considering human-caused changes in adaptation planning and notes that global surface temperature can vary above or below the long-term human-induced trend due to natural variability. This implies that while natural factors play a role, human activities are also driving climate change.

Furthermore, the statement ""Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since AR5 (Figure 2.3)"" suggests that there is evidence for human-caused climate change, which contradicts the claim.

Therefore, while natural factors do play a role in climate change, the evidence also supports the idea that modern climate change is largely driven by human activities, making the claim partially incorrect.

El Niño drove record highs in global temperatures suggesting rise may not be down to man-made emissions.,misleading,incorrect,CORRECT,"((correct))

Explanation: 

The claim that El Niño drove record highs in global temperatures suggesting a rise may not be down to man-made emissions can be evaluated based on the provided evidence. The first piece of evidence shows a range of predicted peak warming values between 1.6 and 1.9, with only one value (1.3) below 2°C, indicating that most predictions suggest global temperatures will exceed this threshold. However, it is essential to note that these projections are based on various climate models and scenarios.

The second piece of evidence highlights the strengthening attribution of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones to human influence since AR5 (Figure 2.3). This suggests that while natural climate variability like El Niño may contribute to temperature fluctuations, the overall trend and magnitude of warming are more likely due to human activities.

Given this evidence, it appears that the claim is supported by the fact that most climate models predict global temperatures will exceed 2°C, but the attribution of these changes to human influence is strengthened over time. Therefore, the verdict is that the claim is correct.

Scientists studying Antarctica sea ice warn a rise in accumulation could spark the next ice age.,incorrect,incorrect,ERROR_PARSING_RESPONSE,"((correct))

Explanation:

The claim that scientists studying Antarctica sea ice warn a rise in accumulation could spark the next ice age is supported by the evidence provided. The World Glacier and Permafrost Assessment (WGI) Box TS.1 states that ""the probability of ice sheet collapse increases with higher global surface temperatures"" (Reference: WGI Box TS.1, URL: [insert URL]). This suggests a link between rising temperatures and increased risk of ice sheet collapse.

The WGII Cross-Chapter Box DEEP also mentions the potential for ice sheet collapse in response to warming temperatures, stating that ""risks for coastal ecosystems, people and infrastructure will continue to increase beyond 2100"" (Reference: WGII Cross-Chapter Box DEEP, URL: [insert URL]). This implies that even if global surface temperatures remain below 2°C, the risks associated with ice sheet collapse will still be significant.

Furthermore, the evidence highlights the potential for Antarctica sea ice accumulation to impact global climate patterns. The provided text mentions ""the AntarcticSea-ice ecosystems from sea-ice change in the Arctic"" (Reference: [insert URL]), which suggests that changes in one region can have far-reaching consequences for other regions.

While the level of confidence is not explicitly stated, the high conﬁdence associated with the probability and rate of ice mass loss increase with higher global surface temperatures (high conﬁdence) suggests a strong basis for this claim.

Scientists have found no consistent correlation between CO2 and temperature; scientists do not know whether earth will warm or cool in future,inaccurate,incorrect,CORRECT,"((correct)), ((low))

Explanation:
The claim states that scientists have found no consistent correlation between CO2 and temperature, and that they do not know whether the Earth will warm or cool in the future. However, the evidence provided suggests that there is a strong correlation between CO2 concentrations and global surface temperature increase.

According to the evidence, the concentration of GHGs (including CO2) has increased significantly since 1850-1900, leading to an observed warming of 1.1°C by 2011-2020 compared to the same period in the past. This correlation is further supported by the fact that the warming is human-caused, with warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling.

However, it's worth noting that the evidence does not explicitly state a consistent correlation between CO2 concentrations and future temperature changes. The statement ""scientists do not know whether earth will warm or cool in future"" is also supported by the fact that internal variability and other drivers of climate change (such as solar and volcanic activity) can mask the effects of GHG warming.

Therefore, while there is strong evidence for a correlation between CO2 concentrations and global surface temperature increase, the claim's assertion about the lack of consistency or uncertainty regarding future temperature changes is partially supported by the evidence. However, given the complexity of climate change and the many factors that influence it, this level of certainty is not high.

I would not agree that carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.,incorrect,incorrect,CORRECT,"((correct))

Explanation:
The claim that carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to global warming can be evaluated based on the provided evidence. The first piece of evidence states that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver of current global acidification of the surface open ocean, which suggests a strong link between CO2 emissions and climate change.

The second piece of evidence provides robust findings from studies on the economic benefits of limiting warming to 1.5°C versus 2°C. These findings indicate that even without accounting for various factors or co-benefits of mitigation, the global benefits of limiting warming to 2°C exceed the cost of mitigation (medium confidence). Furthermore, limiting warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C would increase the costs of mitigation but also increase the benefits in terms of reduced impacts and related risks.

These findings suggest that CO2 emissions are a significant contributor to global warming, and limiting warming to 1.5°C is likely to have substantial economic benefits while reducing the risks associated with climate change.

"We have been cooling down for the past 4000 years; the Earth has cooled since the ‘medieval warming’, It’s all about when you start the measurements.",inaccurate,incorrect,NOT_ENOUGH_INFORMATION,"((correct))

Explanation:

The claim that the Earth has cooled down for the past 4000 years, with the most recent warm period being around 125,000 years ago, is partially supported by the evidence. The statement that it's all about when you start the measurements is also correct.

Prior to the current warming period, there were indeed previous warm periods caused by slow orbital variations, as stated in the evidence. However, the evidence also clearly states that the most recent warming period (between 1850-1900 and 2010-2019) is primarily caused by human activities, with a high level of confidence.

The statement about the global upper ocean warming since the 1970s and the attribution of human influence as the main driver is also supported by the evidence. The fact that ocean warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system, while land warming, ice loss, and atmospheric warming accounted for around 5%, 3%, and 1%, respectively, further supports this conclusion.

Therefore, the claim that we have been cooling down for the past 4000 years is incorrect, as it contradicts the evidence that the most recent warming period is primarily caused by human activities. However, the statement that it's all about when you start the measurements is correct, as it highlights the importance of considering the time frame and starting point for temperature measurements.

Antarctic sea-ice extent is increasing to record levels. Antarctica is getting colder; its sea ice and ice cap are not melting,inaccurate,incorrect,INCORRECT,"((correct)), ((incorrect))

Explanation:

The claim that ""Antarctic sea-ice extent is increasing to record levels"" and ""Antarctica is getting colder; its sea ice and ice cap are not melting"" can be evaluated based on the provided evidence.

Firstly, the evidence suggests that Antarctica's ice sheet mass loss has been occurring since the 1990s (WGII Cross-Chapter Box DEEP), which contradicts the claim of ""Antarctica is getting colder; its sea ice and ice cap are not melting"". This indicates that the Antarctic ice sheet is indeed showing signs of melting, contrary to the claim.

Secondly, the evidence also shows that Arctic sea ice loss has been occurring since 1979 (Arctic sea ice loss since 1979), which suggests a global trend of ice sheet melting. However, this does not directly relate to Antarctica's sea-ice extent. Nevertheless, it reinforces the idea that climate change is causing ice sheet melting globally.

The evidence also mentions that the probability and rate of ice mass loss increase with higher global surface temperatures (high conﬁdence), which supports the notion that Antarctica's ice sheet is also experiencing melting due to rising temperatures.

Therefore, based on the provided evidence, the claim ""Antarctic sea-ice extent is increasing to record levels"" and ""Antarctica is getting colder; its sea ice and ice cap are not melting"" can be classified as ((incorrect)).",CORRECT,CORRECT,"((correct)), ((incorrect))

Explanation:
The claim states that if the global mean temperature rises by more than two degrees Celsius, we'll pass a point of no return. However, the evidence suggests that there is still a significant probability (46-47%) that peak global warming will stay below 2°C, with some studies indicating a 50% probability (69%) and others suggesting a range of probabilities between 31% and 3%. The median probability across all studies is around 5%, which indicates that the likelihood of exceeding 2°C is relatively low.

Furthermore, the evidence highlights that pathways leading to more than 4°C warming by 2100 would require significant reversals in current technology and/or mitigation policy trends. This suggests that even if global temperatures rise above 2°C, it's not necessarily a point of no return, as significant changes in policies or technologies could potentially mitigate further warming.

Climate projections using models based on the water vapor feedback have consistently failed.,unsupported,incorrect,CORRECT,"((correct))

Explanation: 

The claim that climate projections using models based on the water vapor feedback have consistently failed is not supported by the provided evidence. In fact, the evidence suggests that climate models have made significant progress in recent years, particularly with regards to constraining global surface temperature, ocean warming, and sea level projections.

The use of observations and multiple lines of evidence has narrowed the likely range of equilibrium climate sensitivity to 2.5°C to 4.0°C (with a best estimate of 3.0°C), which indicates that models are becoming more accurate in their projections. This is also supported by the fact that future climate change is projected to increase the severity of impacts across natural and human systems, which suggests that models are capturing key aspects of climate change.

The only potential limitation mentioned in the evidence is the assumption that irrigated areas are not water-limited, but this does not necessarily imply that models based on water vapor feedback have failed. Additionally, the fact that models do not represent pests, diseases, future agro-technological changes, and some extreme climate responses may be seen as a limitation, but it does not necessarily mean that models based on water vapor feedback have failed.

Therefore, based on the provided evidence, it is unlikely that climate projections using models based on the water vapor feedback have consistently failed.

The use of observations and multiple lines of evidence has narrowed the likely range of equilibrium climate sensitivity to 2.5°C to 4.0°C (with a best estimate of 3.0°C), which indicates that models are becoming more accurate in their projections. This is also supported by the fact that future climate change is projected to increase the severity of impacts across natural and human systems, which suggests that models are capturing key aspects of climate change.

The only potential limitation mentioned in the evidence is the assumption that irrigated areas are not water-limited, but this does not necessarily imply that models based on water vapor feedback have failed. Additionally, the fact that models do not represent pests, diseases, future agro-technological changes, and some extreme climate responses may be seen as a limitation, but it does not necessarily mean that models based on water vapor feedback have failed.

Therefore, based on the provided evidence, it is unlikely that climate projections using models based on the water vapor feedback have consistently failed.

Father of Global Warming’ Scientist Finally Admits Theory Is Wrong,inaccurate,incorrect,CORRECT,"((correct))

Explanation:
The claim that the ""Father of Global Warming"" scientist finally admits that the theory is wrong is not supported by the provided evidence. The evidence suggests that the cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal, indicating that climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health (very high confidence). This contradicts the idea that the theory is wrong.

The evidence from WGIII SPM C.11.2 states that ""the evidence is too limited to make a similar robust conclusion for limiting warming to 1.5°C."" This suggests that while there may be limitations in the current evidence, it does not necessarily mean that the theory of global warming is wrong.

Furthermore, the evidence from WGII SPM and WGIII SPM indicates that the scientific consensus on climate change is strong, with high confidence in its impacts on human well-being and planetary health.

Therefore, based on the provided evidence, it can be concluded that the claim is false.

Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide has helped raise global food production and reduce poverty.,unsupported,incorrect,NOT_ENOUGH_INFORMATION,"((not_enough_information))

Explanation:
While the provided evidence highlights the importance of international cooperation and climate resilient development, it does not directly address the claim that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide has helped raise global food production and reduce poverty. The evidence primarily focuses on emissions reductions from fossil fuels and industrial processes, as well as the distribution of greenhouse gas emissions among households.

The evidence does mention accelerated international financial cooperation as a critical enabler of low-GHG transitions, but it does not explicitly link this to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide or its impact on food production and poverty reduction. Therefore, without more direct information connecting these concepts, it is challenging to assess the claim accurately.

Explanation:
The claim is based on a common misconception that if a group of experts changes their opinion, it must be incorrect. However, this reasoning ignores the fact that scientific understanding and evidence can evolve over time as new data becomes available.

In this case, the evidence provided shows that there is overwhelming consensus among climate scientists that human activities are the main driver of global warming. The high confidence level (virtually certain for ocean warming and extremely likely for human influence) in the evidence suggests that the shift from ""global cooling"" to ""global warming"" is not a change in opinion, but rather a reflection of new data and understanding.

The provided evidence includes:

* Ocean warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system (high confidence)
* Human influence is the main driver of global warming (extremely likely)
* Global surface temperature has increased by 1.1°C since 1850-1900 (high confidence)
* Concentrations of GHGs have increased, contributing to global warming

These findings are consistent with the scientific consensus on climate change, which is supported by multiple lines of evidence from various fields of science.

"The bushfires in Australia were caused by arsonists and a series of lightning strikes, not ‘climate change’.",misleading,incorrect,NOT_ENOUGH_INFORMATION,"((correct))

Explanation: 

The claim that the bushfires in Australia were caused by arsonists and a series of lightning strikes, not 'climate change', is incorrect. The evidence provided suggests that human influence on climate change has strengthened since AR5 (Figure 2.3), which implies that climate change is a contributing factor to extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones.

The sequence of large explosive volcanic eruptions mentioned in the evidence would indeed lead to substantial cooling globally and regional climate perturbations over several decades, but this event is considered a low-likelihood high-impact event. However, it does not negate the impact of human-induced climate change on extreme weather events.

Therefore, based on the provided evidence, it can be concluded that 'climate change' is a contributing factor to the bushfires in Australia, making the claim incorrect.

CO2 is not the cause of our current warming trend; Arctic sea ice has expanded in recent years; Polar bears’ population is growing and is not threatened by climate change; CO2 is good for plant life,incorrect,incorrect,CORRECT,"((correct)), ((incorrect)), ((not_enough_information))

Explanation:

The claim that CO2 is not the cause of our current warming trend is incorrect. The evidence provided indicates that human activities, particularly the increase in GHG concentrations, are responsible for the observed warming (Evidence 4). The study concludes that ""observed warming is driven by emissions from human activities with GHG warming partly masked by aerosol cooling"" (Evidence 4).

The claim that Arctic sea ice has expanded in recent years is false. According to the evidence provided, global surface temperature has increased by 1.1°C since 1850-1900, and this increase is largely due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions (Evidence 4). The fact that Arctic sea ice has not expanded in recent years contradicts this finding.

The claim that Polar bears' population is growing and is not threatened by climate change is also incorrect. While the evidence provided does not directly address polar bear populations, it is well-established in scientific literature that climate change is affecting polar bear habitats, prey availability, and overall population trends (not cited in the provided evidence).

Finally, the claim that CO2 is good for plant life is false. The evidence provided indicates that increases in CO2 concentrations have a net cooling effect due to anthropogenic aerosols, which peaked in the late 20th century (Evidence 1). While CO2 is essential for plant growth, the current concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is not beneficial for plant life.

The warming is not nearly as great as the climate change computer models have predicted.,misleading,incorrect,CORRECT,"((correct))

Explanation: 

The claim that ""The warming is not nearly as great as the climate change computer models have predicted"" can be evaluated based on the provided evidence. The evidence suggests that the current understanding of climate change is limited by several factors, including:

* The lack of representation of pests, diseases, and future agro-technological changes in climate models (Evidence: Models do not represent pests, diseases, future agro-technological changes and some extreme climate responses)
* The assumption that irrigated areas are not water-limited, which may not accurately reflect the actual limitations of these areas (Evidence: Models assume that irrigated areas are not water-limit ed)
* The lack of consideration for regional differences and areas with little or no production, or those that have not been assessed (Evidence: Future climate change is projected to increase the severity of impacts across natural and human systems and will increase regional differences)

These limitations suggest that the current predictions of climate models may be conservative or based on incomplete assumptions. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the warming may not be as great as predicted by climate computer models.

"That one little burp by Mt. Etna has already put more than 10,000 times the CO2 into the atmosphere than mankind has in our entire time on the Earth.",inaccurate,incorrect,NOT_ENOUGH_INFORMATION,"((correct))

Explanation:
The claim is supported by the evidence provided. According to the evidence, concentrations of CH4 and N2O have increased to unprecedented levels in at least 800,000 years (very high confidence), and current CO2 concentrations are higher than at any time over at least the past two million years. This suggests that human activities have led to significant increases in atmospheric GHG concentrations.

While the specific claim about Mt. Etna's burp contributing more than 10,000 times the CO2 into the atmosphere is not directly stated in the evidence, it can be inferred that even a single large event like a volcanic eruption could potentially release a significant amount of CO2 into the atmosphere. The evidence does not provide a specific comparison between the CO2 released by Mt.
