"90 percent of the world’s coral reefs will disappear in the next 35 years due to coral bleaching induced by global warming, pollution, and overdevelopment.",mostly correct,correct,INCORRECT,"((incorrect))

The claim states that 90 percent of the world's coral reefs will disappear in the next 35 years, but the evidence provided suggests a decline of 70-90% at 1.5°C of global warming, not necessarily within the next 35 years. Additionally, the evidence does not specifically mention coral bleaching induced by global warming, pollution, and overdevelopment as the primary cause of this decline.

The SSP1 pathway mentioned in the evidence suggests a scenario with low population growth, high income, and reduced inequalities, which could potentially mitigate some of the impacts on coral reefs. However, the overall assessment is that climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C.

Therefore, while the claim may be based on some factual information, it does not accurately represent the evidence provided, particularly regarding the timeframe and causes of coral reef decline.",INCORRECT,INCORRECT,"((incorrect))

"The jet stream meanders more, with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes.",correct but,correct,CORRECT,"((correct))

The provided evidence suggests that human-caused climate change is the main driver of changes in temperature extremes, including heatwaves and cold waves. This implies a shift in global weather patterns, which could lead to more frequent and intense warm air masses moving towards polar regions (e.g., the frozen north) and less frequent and severe cold air masses moving into warmer southern climes.

The statement about the jet stream meandering more with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes aligns with this understanding of climate change impacts on global weather patterns. Therefore, based on the provided evidence, the claim is accurate.

Evidence:
- Hot extremes have become more frequent and intense across most land regions since the 1950s (high confidence).
- Cold extremes have become less frequent and less severe (high confidence), with human-caused climate change as the main driver.
