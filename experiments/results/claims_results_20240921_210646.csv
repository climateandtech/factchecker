The evidence overwhelmingly supports the idea that modern climate change is primarily caused by human activities, particularly through emissions of greenhouse gases. Human activities have unequivocally caused global warming, with high confidence in this assessment. Additionally, global warming is projected to continue increasing due to increased cumulative CO2 emissions, and various climate change impacts have been observed across the world, with vulnerable populations being the most affected. These factors indicate that modern climate change is predominantly driven by human activities, not solely a naturally occurring phenomenon.', 'based on the evidence provided.\n\nMultiple pieces of evidence indicate that human activities, primarily through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperatures reaching levels significantly above pre-industrial times. Additionally, the evidence highlights that global warming will continue to increase in the near term due to increased cumulative CO2 emissions, with every region projected to face further increases in climate hazards. Furthermore, climate change impacts on health are mediated through natural and human systems, with climate and weather extremes increasingly driving displacement in various regions.\n\nTherefore, the overwhelming evidence points to human activities as the primary driver of modern climate change, contradicting the claim that it is solely a naturally occurring phenomenon.', 'based on the provided evidence. The evidence overwhelmingly supports the idea that human activities, primarily through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming. This is evident from the increase in global surface temperature, the impact on human and natural systems, the attribution of observed changes to human influence, and the projected increase in global warming due to CO2 emissions. The evidence consistently points to human activities as the main driver of climate change, contradicting the notion that modern climate change is solely a naturally occurring phenomenon.']"
