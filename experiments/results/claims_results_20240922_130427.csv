"90 percent of the world’s coral reefs will disappear in the next 35 years due to coral bleaching induced by global warming, pollution, and overdevelopment.",mostly correct,correct,NOT_ENOUGH_INFORMATION,"The claim that 90 percent of the world’s coral reefs will disappear in the next 35 years due to coral bleaching induced by global warming, pollution, and overdevelopment cannot be directly verified based on the provided evidence.

Unprecedented climate change has caused sea level at Sydney Harbour to rise approximately 0.0 cm over the past 140 years.,inaccurate,incorrect,INCORRECT,"Based on the evidence provided, the claim that ""Unprecedented climate change has caused sea level at Sydney Harbour to rise approximately 0.0 cm over the past 140 years"" is ((incorrect)).

The evidence indicates that global mean sea level change has been observed and projected to increase over time due to climate change and emissions. The rate and magnitude of sea level rise are influenced by emissions, with higher emissions leading to greater and faster rates of sea level rise. Therefore, it is unlikely that the sea level at Sydney Harbour has remained unchanged over the past 140 years.

Evidence from the sources suggests that sea levels have been rising globally, which would likely include Sydney Harbour, due to climate change impacts. Therefore, the claim of no sea level rise in Sydney Harbour over the past 140 years is not supported by the provided evidence.

"Peer-reviewed studies, geologic records, and all the studies have shown that we have actually cooled since the Roman Warming Period, and likely since the Medieval Warming Period.",incorrect,incorrect,INCORRECT,"Based on the provided evidence, which indicates that the global surface temperature has increased by around 1.1°C since 1850-1900, it is evident that the claim stating that we have cooled since the Roman Warming Period and likely since the Medieval Warming Period is ((incorrect)).

Evidence and Agreement: 
- High evidence from multiple sources indicating a significant increase in global surface temperature since the 1850-1900 baseline.
- High agreement among the sources that the global surface temperature has risen, contradicting the claim of cooling since historical warming periods.

"Climate changed naturally in prehistoric eras, modern climate change is a naturally occurring phenomenon",flawed reasoning,incorrect,INCORRECT,"The claim that modern climate change is a naturally occurring phenomenon is ((incorrect)) based on the evidence provided. The evidence indicates that climate change has caused substantial damages, irreversible losses, and an increase in major tropical cyclone occurrences over the last four decades (Reference: 428c87b8-fc86-48da-a8d9-c90211238e0e). Additionally, ocean warming has accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system, with contributions from land warming, ice loss, and atmospheric warming, showing significant human-induced changes in the climate system (Reference: 3c85c4a5-864d-435b-95c3-b6bff2f4d083).
