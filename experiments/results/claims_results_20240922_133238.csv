"90 percent of the world’s coral reefs will disappear in the next 35 years due to coral bleaching induced by global warming, pollution, and overdevelopment.",mostly correct,correct,INCORRECT,"Based on the evidence provided, it is ((incorrect)) to claim that 90 percent of the world’s coral reefs will disappear in the next 35 years due to coral bleaching induced by global warming, pollution, and overdevelopment. The evidence states that coral reefs are projected to decline by a further 70–90% at 1.5°C of global warming with high confidence. While the evidence does show a significant decline in coral reefs, it does not support the specific claim of a 90 percent disappearance within the next 35 years.",INCORRECT,INCORRECT,"Based on the evidence provided, it is ((incorrect)) to claim that 90 percent of the world’s coral reefs will disappear in the next 35 years due to coral bleaching induced by global warming, pollution, and overdevelopment.

Unprecedented climate change has caused sea level at Sydney Harbour to rise approximately 0.0 cm over the past 140 years.,inaccurate,incorrect,INCORRECT,"The claim that sea level at Sydney Harbour has risen approximately 0.0 cm over the past 140 years is ((incorrect)).

Based on the evidence provided, global mean sea level increased by 0.20 meters between 1901 and 2018. This indicates a significant rise in sea levels globally over the past century, which would likely have affected Sydney Harbour as well. The evidence of global mean sea level change contradicts the claim that there has been no rise in sea level at Sydney Harbour over the past 140 years.

Therefore, the claim is incorrect based on the information provided.",INCORRECT,INCORRECT,"The claim that sea level at Sydney Harbour has risen approximately 0.0 cm over the past 140 years is ((incorrect)).

"Peer-reviewed studies, geologic records, and all the studies have shown that we have actually cooled since the Roman Warming Period, and likely since the Medieval Warming Period.",incorrect,incorrect,INCORRECT,"The claim that we have cooled since the Roman Warming Period and likely since the Medieval Warming Period is ((incorrect)) based on the provided evidence. The evidence states that the global surface temperature has increased by around 1.1°C since 1850–1900, and formal detection and attribution studies show that all the warming observed between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019 is caused by humans. Additionally, the estimated temperature during the warmest multi-century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which occurred around 6500 years ago, was higher than the current temperatures. Therefore, the evidence contradicts the claim that we have cooled since historical warming periods.

"Climate changed naturally in prehistoric eras, modern climate change is a naturally occurring phenomenon",flawed reasoning,incorrect,INCORRECT,"The claim that modern climate change is a naturally occurring phenomenon is ((incorrect)) based on the evidence provided. The evidence states that recent changes in the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years, with human-caused greenhouse gas emissions being the main driver of tropospheric warming and human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion being the main driver of stratospheric cooling. Additionally, it is highlighted that the warming observed between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019 is attributed to humans. The evidence clearly indicates that human activities are significantly influencing the climate, refuting the notion that modern climate change is solely a naturally occurring phenomenon.
